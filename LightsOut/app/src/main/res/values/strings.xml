        Lights Out is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to
        turn off all the lights on a grid. To play, start with a grid of lights,
        some of which are on and some are off. The goal is to turn off all the lights,
        but there\'s a catch: when you press a light to toggle it, it also affects the
        adjacent lights, switching them from on to off or vice versa. The puzzle begins
        with a predetermined pattern of lights, and your task is to find the right
        sequence of moves to turn them all off. As you progress through the levels,
        the patterns become more complex, requiring strategic thinking and careful
        planning to solve. The ultimate objective is to find the minimum number of
        moves to extinguish all the lights. Lights Out is a mentally stimulating and
        addictive game that challenges your problem-solving skills.</string>
